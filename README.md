SageMaker is an end to end machine learning platform for customers to train and host models on managed environment. Based on different usage, customers can choose to train models by using built-in algorithms or custom algorithms. Whole environment is hosted by AWS so you just focus on application. In this workshop we introduce how to use built-in algorithm to setup recommendation model.
